## 🌀 Project Description

**ThirstMeter™** is a useless but oddly satisfying simulator that counts how many droplets of water it takes to quench your thirst. It’s slow, dramatic, and makes you question your hydration levels and life choices.

---

## ❓ The Problem (That Doesn't Exist)

Everyone’s always asking *“Did you drink enough water?”*  
But no one asks *“How many droplets exactly?”*  
We're here to solve that.

---

## 🧪 The Solution (That Nobody Asked For)

 **ThirstMeter™** helps you find your *true* hydration point. Just sit back and watch your thirst fade. Slowly. Painfully. Beautifully.
